# COPILOT NOTES - Future Agent Testing Instructions

## Date: September 5, 2025
## Context: Broadcasting State Enhancement Implementation

### CHANGES MADE TODAY:
1. ‚úÖ Updated `connections.html` with detailed app developer instructions
2. ‚úÖ Enhanced connections page to display 3 broadcasting states:
   - üì° BROADCASTING (green)
   - ‚è∏Ô∏è STANDBY (yellow) 
   - üî¥ DISABLED (red)
3. ‚úÖ Added new `/api/broadcasting-disabled` endpoint in `server.js`
4. ‚úÖ Updated client tracking logic to handle explicit disabled state

### TESTING REQUIRED ON MAIN PC:

#### 1. SERVER STARTUP TEST:
```bash
cd telemetry-backend
npm start
```
- ‚úÖ Verify server starts without errors
- ‚úÖ Check console shows "Server running on port 3000"
- ‚úÖ Confirm `/api/broadcasting-disabled` endpoint is available

#### 2. CONNECTIONS PAGE TEST:
- Navigate to: `http://localhost:3000/connections.html`
- ‚úÖ Verify page loads correctly with new 3-state design
- ‚úÖ Check that sections display:
  - "üéÆ Racing Apps" (for actual racing applications)
  - "üë• Viewers & Spectators" (for web browsers)
- ‚úÖ Verify responsive design works on mobile

#### 3. BROADCASTING STATE LOGIC TEST:
**Manual API Testing:**
```bash
# Test the new disabled endpoint
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/broadcasting-disabled \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "User-Agent: RadianTelemetryApp/1.0" \
  -d '{"broadcastingEnabled": false, "driverName": "TestDriver"}'
```
- ‚úÖ Verify endpoint responds with success
- ‚úÖ Check connections page shows client as "üî¥ DISABLED"

#### 4. STATE TRANSITION TESTING:
Test the 3 broadcasting states:
1. **BROADCASTING**: App sends telemetry data
   - Should show "üì° BROADCASTING" (green)
2. **STANDBY**: App connected but not sending telemetry (5+ seconds)
   - Should show "‚è∏Ô∏è STANDBY" (yellow)
3. **DISABLED**: App explicitly calls `/api/broadcasting-disabled`
   - Should show "üî¥ DISABLED" (red)

#### 5. USER AGENT DETECTION TEST:
- ‚úÖ Test with browser (should appear in "Viewers & Spectators")
- ‚úÖ Test with custom User-Agent containing "Radian" (should appear in "Racing Apps")

### FILES MODIFIED:
- `public/connections.html` - Enhanced UI and 3-state logic
- `server.js` - Added `/api/broadcasting-disabled` endpoint and state tracking
- `COPILOT-NOTES.md` - This file

### DEPLOYMENT NOTES:
- These changes are ready for Render deployment
- No breaking changes to existing functionality
- New endpoint is additive (won't break existing apps)
- Existing apps will continue working but show as STANDBY when not broadcasting

### KNOWN ISSUES TO VERIFY:
1. Make sure the new endpoint doesn't interfere with existing telemetry flow
2. Verify client cleanup timers still work correctly
3. Check that state transitions happen smoothly without memory leaks

### NEXT STEPS AFTER TESTING:
1. If tests pass ‚Üí Deploy to Render
2. Update app development team with the new User-Agent requirements
3. Implement the `/api/broadcasting-disabled` call in the racing app
4. Test full integration with real racing app

---
**Note**: This system now properly distinguishes between 3 scenarios that were previously conflated into 2 states, solving the logical gap identified in the connection tracking system.

## TRACK MAP ENHANCEMENTS - September 5, 2025

### NEW FEATURES ADDED:
1. ‚úÖ **Car Ahead/Behind Position Markers**:
   - Added visual markers on track map for cars ahead and behind
   - Uses `CarDistAhead` and `CarDistBehind` telemetry fields
   - Cars shown with different icons (`icon-idle.png` for ahead, `icon-standby.png` for behind)
   - Labels: "A" for ahead car, "B" for behind car

2. ‚úÖ **Track Info Boxes**:
   - Added 4 info boxes below the track map
   - **Car Ahead**: Distance to car ahead (meters)
   - **Car Behind**: Distance to car behind (meters) 
   - **Fuel Level**: Current fuel as percentage
   - **Estimated Laps**: Calculated remaining laps based on fuel consumption

### FILES MODIFIED:
- `public/track.html` - Added info boxes grid and initialization script
- `public/trackmap.js` - Enhanced with car positioning and info display logic
- `public/styles.css` - Added responsive CSS for track info boxes

### TESTING REQUIRED ON MAIN PC:

#### 1. TRACK MAP VISUAL TEST:
- Navigate to: `http://localhost:3000/track.html`
- ‚úÖ Verify track map displays correctly
- ‚úÖ Check info boxes appear below the map in a 2x2 grid
- ‚úÖ Verify responsive design works on mobile (becomes single column)

#### 2. TELEMETRY DATA TEST:
With live telemetry connected:
- ‚úÖ Verify car ahead/behind distances show in meters when available
- ‚úÖ Check fuel level percentage displays correctly
- ‚úÖ Confirm estimated laps calculation works (fuel level √∑ average fuel per lap)
- ‚úÖ Verify "--" displays when data is unavailable

#### 3. VISUAL MARKERS TEST:
With cars nearby:
- ‚úÖ Verify "A" marker appears on track for car ahead
- ‚úÖ Verify "B" marker appears on track for car behind  
- ‚úÖ Check markers are positioned correctly relative to player car
- ‚úÖ Verify markers wrap around track correctly

#### 4. INFO BOX UPDATES TEST:
- ‚úÖ Check that all info boxes update in real-time with telemetry
- ‚úÖ Verify fuel percentage matches actual tank level
- ‚úÖ Test estimated laps calculation accuracy
- ‚úÖ Ensure smooth updates without flickering

### TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION:
- Car positions calculated using track length estimation and distance conversion
- Fuel data integrated from existing telemetry dashboard fuel calculations
- Position markers use interpolation along smoothed track path
- Responsive CSS grid for mobile compatibility

### KNOWN LIMITATIONS:
- Car positioning accuracy depends on track mapping quality
- Distance calculations are estimates based on track geometry
- Requires completed lap data for positioning (cars won't show until track is mapped)
